A. **Set up SSH authentication between your computer and your GitHub account**
   - Steps:
     1. Generated SSH key using:
        ```bash
        ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
        ```
     2. Added the public key to GitHub under **Settings > SSH and GPG Keys**.
     3. Verified the connection using:
        ```bash
        ssh -T git@github.com
        ```
     4. I then confirmed this worked by getting the message below:
	'Hi nmkjk64! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.'  	
   - Obstacles:
     - Encountered `Permission denied (publickey)` error.
     - Resolved by adding the key to the SSH agent:
       ```bash
       ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
       ```
 
B. **Install Quarto onto your computer following the instructions of Get Started**
   - Steps:
     1. Downloaded Quarto from [Quarto.org](https://quarto.org).
     2. Installed TinyTeX to render PDFs:
        ```bash
        quarto install tinytex
        ```
     3. Verified the installation:
        ```bash
        quarto check
        ```
   - Obstacles:
     - Missing TeX installation, resolved by installing TinyTeX. It orginally did not print a test pdf I had created.


C. **Pick a tool of your choice (e.g., VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, Emacs, etc.), follow the instructions to reproduce the example of line plot on polar axis**
   - Tool: Python in Terminal
   - Steps:
     1. Wrote the following Python code to create a polar line plot:
        ```{python}
        import numpy as np
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

	theta = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
	r  = 1 + np.sin(4*theta)

	fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
	ax.plot(theta, r)

	ax.set_title("Line Plot on Polar Axis")
	plt.savefig("hw1_plot.pdf", format="pdf") # save the plot here

	plt.show()
        ```
     2. Saved the code as `hw1.py` and ran it:
        ```bash
        python hw1.py
        ```
     3. Created a PDF of the plot within the python code:
        ```markdown
        ---
        title: "Line Plot on Polar Axis"
        format: pdf
        ---
        ```
     - Obstacles 
     	- This phase went quite smoothly. 
	- Largest problem was rendering a pdf of the plot. This was easily fixed by using the 'plt.savefig()' function with the format		='pdf'. I saw that I did not have to render this plot to pdf specfically through Quarto.

D. **Render the homework into a pdf file and put the file into a release in your GitHub repo**
   - Steps:
     1. Rendered the `.qmd` file into a PDF:
        ```bash
        quarto render hw1.qmd --to pdf
        ```
     2. Verified that `hw1.pdf` was created.
     3. Created a GitHub release and uploaded the PDF:
        - Attached 'polar line plot'
        - Attached `hw1.pdf`.

### **Output Structure**
When rendered, this will produce:
- Numbered sections (1, 2, 3, 4) for **a, b, c, d**.
- Subsections (e.g., 1.1, 1.2) with further indented details.
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks for commands and Python code.
